            <br>
            <li>After Understanding HTML And CSS, We Headed Towards JavaScript. Comparatively, JS Was A Difficult Task To Work On.</li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li>After All This, Our First HomeWork Was To Make An Application Form and A Time Table Using HTML And Basic CSS.</li>
            <br>
            <div>
                <img src="images/table ss.png" alt="Time Table">
                <img src="images/form ss.png" alt="Application Form">
